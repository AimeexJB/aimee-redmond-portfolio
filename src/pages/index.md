Hello, my name is Aimee Redmond. I am a 23 year old and just recently completed my degree in Computer Science and graduated with honours. I moved to Glasgow towards the end of 2019 and I am currently in a Junior Web Developer role discovering new ways to code. 

My main focus in this degree was always Web Development, in the Front End and Back End, as I am very passionate about it. A few of my skills include are, knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and experience with frameworks such as ReactJS, VueJS and Laravel, with the different languages such as JavaScript and PHP and lastly, technologies such as MongoDB, Google Cloud Platform and GitHub.
