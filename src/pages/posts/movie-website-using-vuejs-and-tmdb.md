This is an experimental movie website using a combination of VueJS and TMDB. It was completed by me and a friend as part of our 3rd year College project. 

We researched many different Movie and TV websites/trackers and chose our favourite bits a put them all together to create this one app.

The App allows you to create and account and login, view Top Movies and TV shows along with all the information about them and also allows you to add any of theses movies or shows to 3 separate lists; To Watch, Watched and Favourites.

The project is hosted using the Firebase database which keeps track of the users ID and all of the lists for each user.
